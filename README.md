# Coffee-Sales

In this end to end project, I gather, transform, and analyze data using pivot tables and charts to build a dynamic dashboard in Microsoft Excel. This Coffe Sales dashboard features a line chart showing total sales over time split by coffee type. A bar chart illustrating sales split by country . There is a line chart to manipulate visuals. Lastly, I created three slicers that filter through roast type, packaging size, and if customers are Loyalty members.
